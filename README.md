# XDBeam Federation

### Get Paid To Your Email Address

#### DigitalBits' premier public federation service

This is part of [XDBeam][7], my project for the [**Next Top Blockchain Startup** Hackathon][1].
It is an open federation service, which allows anyone to make payments to you by using your email address followed by "\*xdbe.am", instead of remembering a 56-digit string.
Plus, when using the [XDBeam Wallet][2], users don't even have to remember the suffix.

Currently everything is in the prototype-building stage, and not ready for use.
The service will soon be available at [federation.XDBe.am][5]

Watch [the XDBeam introduction video][4] for more information and a walkthrough of the whole XDBeam system.

If you have any feedback or advice, I can be contacted through info@xdbe.am or w.surjenko@gmail.com.
